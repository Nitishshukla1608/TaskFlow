Understood. I will await your confirmation that the file access issues have been resolved, or the information requested in `FILE_ACCESS_DEBUG.md` to help me debug the problem.

Once I can reliably access the files, I can then proceed with debugging the `CRA_Task` component's `console.log` output and implementing the `yourTotal` increment feature.
