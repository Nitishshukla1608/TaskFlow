I am still encountering "File not found" errors when trying to access `src/Components/Cards/Admin/CRA_Task.jsx`.

This indicates that the fundamental issue with file system access, which I highlighted in `FILE_ACCESS_DEBUG.md`, is **not yet resolved**. I cannot read, modify, or debug any code in this component until I can reliably access its file.

**Please address the file system access problem first.** Refer back to the `FILE_ACCESS_DEBUG.md` file for the information I need from you to diagnose and hopefully resolve this.

Once I can access `CRA_Task.jsx`, I can then proceed to debug why it's consoling only one element of the array and implement the `yourTotal` feature.
