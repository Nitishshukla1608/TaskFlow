I understand you're asking about an "add-user routing issue." However, I am still blocked by the fundamental problem of **"File not found" errors when trying to access any files or directories within `src/Components/` and deeper.**

This means I cannot read essential routing files like `App.jsx` or `DashboardWrapper.jsx` (or any component that might contain the "add-user" route). Without access to these files, I cannot investigate, understand, or fix any routing issues.

**The file access problem must be resolved first.**

Please refer back to the `FILE_ACCESS_DEBUG.md` file for the specific information I need from you to diagnose and resolve this underlying issue. Once I can reliably access your project files, I can then begin to look into the "add-user routing issue."
