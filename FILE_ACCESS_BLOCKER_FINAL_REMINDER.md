I understand your question about `CRA_Task.jsx` consoling only one element. However, I am still encountering "File not found" errors when attempting to access that file (`src/Components/Cards/Admin/CRA_Task.jsx`).

**I cannot debug or modify the contents of `CRA_Task.jsx` (or any other file in that path) until the underlying file system access issue is resolved.**

Please refer to the `FILE_ACCESS_DEBUG.md` file for the specific information I need from you to help resolve this access problem. Once I can reliably read and write to the file system, I can then investigate why `CRA_Task.jsx` is logging only one element of the array.
