I'm still unable to access files within the `src/Components/` directory, which is preventing me from making any further progress on your requests, including implementing the `yourTotal` increment feature.

As previously mentioned in `FILE_ACCESS_DEBUG.md`, I need your help to diagnose why my tools cannot find these files.

**Could you please provide the information I requested in `FILE_ACCESS_DEBUG.md`?** Specifically:

1.  **Confirm the exact, absolute path to `CRA_Task.jsx` on your system.**
2.  **Verify that the agent's current working directory (`D:\DEVELOPMENT materials\FRONTEND\Projects\TaskFlow`) is indeed the correct and accessible root of your project.**
3.  **Confirm from your end that the file `D:\DEVELOPMENT materials\FRONTEND\Projects\TaskFlow\src\Components\Cards\Admin\CRA_Task.jsx` is accessible and readable.**

Once I can reliably access these files, I can proceed with implementing the remaining features and fixing any other issues.
